This mod fixes crashes of [Create Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) that happened to me regularly. For example:
- [when taking items out of assembled containers and then disassembling (#1080)](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues/1080)
- [when a deployer kills a mob (#1096)](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues/1096)
